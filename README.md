## Project Overview

This project presents a **Bank Customer Churn Dashboard** created using **Tableau** and **Python** to analyze and visualize factors contributing to customer churn in a bank. The dashboard is designed to help business stakeholders quickly identify patterns and trends in customer behavior, especially those leading to churn.

It includes:
- Overall churn rate
- Customer demographics breakdown (age, gender, geography)
- Financial metrics (account balance, credit score, AUM, estimated salary)
- Top 5 features influencing churn based on machine learning feature importance

- **Age** are the most influential features for churn.
- Customers aged 35 to 45 have a higher likelihood of churn.
